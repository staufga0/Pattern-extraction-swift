# Pattern extraction in Swift

This project is being made as part of the course **Outils Formels Avancé** from UNIGE

# How to run the program?
* Have downloaded projects to analyse
* Go to the root of the project
* `swift run`

# How to download projects?
* Go to `downloading_projects/`
* Setup the file `active_url_list.txt`
* Run `downloading_projects.py` (only works on linux because it needs you to have `git`, `find` and `rm`)
* Finally, move the generated directory `downloading_projects/files` inside of `swift_files/`
